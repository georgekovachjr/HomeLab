Home Lab
Originally, it was just my pen test vm lab. 



# Design
![Network Design & Topology](./img/Network Design.jpg)

# Tools
Router - DD WRT on a Nighthawk Router with PIA VPN and iptables to mirror
Hypervisor - VMWare ESXi on an HP z420 Server with 50 VM's of various types
SIEM - SecurityOnion
IDS/IPS - Snort 2 on Debian 11
Firewall - pfSense


And a library of vulnerable machines and OS's. 
All the data is real from my actual daily computer and gaming computer. 
My next step is to add the iptables to draw websites for my Burp Pro.

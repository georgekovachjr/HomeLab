Home Lab
Originally, it was just my pen test vm lab. 
DD WRT on a Nighthawk Router with PIA VPN and iptables to mirror
VMWare ESXi on an HP z420 Server with 50 VM's of various types
Now it's a SIEM and vulnerable machines and a library of OS's. I've built a Snort IDS/IPS, SecurityOnion SIEM with pfSense. 
All the data is real from my actual daily computer and gaming computer. 
My next step is to add the iptables to draw websites for my Burp Pro.
